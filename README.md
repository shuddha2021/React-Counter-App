Okay, I can add some additional resources links in the readme and rewrite it. Here is the updated markdown text:

# React Counter App

This is a simple React counter app that allows you to increment, decrement, and reset a count value. It uses TypeScript, React hooks, and CSS for styling.

## Features

- The app displays the current count value in a large font.
- The app has three buttons: +, -, and Reset.
- The + button increments the count value by one.
- The - button decrements the count value by one.
- The Reset button sets the count value to zero.
- The app logs the current count value to the console whenever it changes.

## How to start the app

To start the app, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Then follow these steps:

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the project folder and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
- Run `npm start` to start the development server and open the app in your browser.
- Enjoy the app and feel free to modify it as you wish.
